		<p class="intro">
			Whilst working as a Harvard 'computer', cataloguing the brightnesses of stars from thousands of photographic plates, Henrietta Leavitt discovered certain stars would cycle from dim to bright and back. With an insight that would change astronomy, Leavitt realised the true brightness of these stars was related to the speed of their cycle. By comparing true and observed brightness all of a sudden astronomers had a standard reference by which to calculate distances. Although little credited in her lifetime, Leavitt's work helped show the world the true measure of the cosmos.

				<p class="text-center col-title">Life</p>
				<p class="desc">Henrietta Swan Leavitt was an American astronomer, who was employed by Harvard Observatory as a human 'computer'. She was one of many women who were hired to perform tedious work, examining photographic plates to measure and record the brightness of many thousands of stars. Whilst there she made a discovery that would change astronomy.</p>
				<p class="desc">Pickering, director of the observatory, assigned Leavitt the task of cataloguing variable stars. She discovered thousands of these stars in the Magellanic Clouds, what are now known to be two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Whilst examining these stars, Leavitt noted that some of them (now called Cepheid Variables) seemed to show a pattern. Those with greater intrinsic luminosity (brightness) also had a longer period (time taken to cycle from brightest to dimmest). In 1908 she published these findings in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College.</p>
				<p class="desc">She then made the leap that these variables in the Magellanic Clouds were approximately the same distance from Earth, and so use their observed luminosity relative to each other as a stand in for their intrinsic luminosity. Leavitt published her work again in 1912, with a graph showing that the log of the star's period is linearly  and directly related to the log of the star's intrinsic luminosity.</p>
				<p class="desc">When combined with the work of Ejnar Hertzsprung, who measured the distance to nearby Cepheid Variables using parallax, Leavitt had now provided a cosmic 'standard candle', where by comparing the observed luminosity with a true luminosity derived from the period, the distance to that star could be derived. This technique would be used by Hubble and others to show that the universe was more than the Milky Way, and in fact was a universe of galaxies. </p>
